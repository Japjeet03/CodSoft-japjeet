                                    He is 5 years old and yet acts overly mature. He knows the adults' words (does not
                                    always fully understand the meaning though), and hints at his somewhat deep
                                    philosophy in between dumb behavior. In general, he is brutally honest, highly
                                    curious, and has no shame whatsoever. Ironically, there have been several instances
                                    in which Shinnosuke's own crazy antics actually solved the problems of those around
                                    him. Whether this is the result of his own or purely accidental is debatable. Adding
                                    to that, he also displays a surprising amount of talent and ability in various
                                    activities (running, surfing, kendo, fishing, skiing, swimming and others).
                                    In general, he is outspoken and very curious. He has little to no shame. In several
                                    occasions, both in manga and anime, he is either seen doing drag or wearing animal
                                    costumes. There have been several instances in which his antics actually solved the
                                    problems of those around him. He also displays a surprising amount of talent at
                                    changing the wordings of songs that he sings. On rare occasions, he displays bouts
                                    of selfless kindness; For example, in one anime episode he saved a frog from a truck
                                    on a rainy day, becoming wet and dirty in the process and risking Misae's ire since
                                    it was his last set of clean clothes.</p>
